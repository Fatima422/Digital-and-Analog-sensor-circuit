# Digital-and-Analog-sensor-circuit
Analog and digital signals are the types of signals that carry information. The main difference between both signals is that analogue signals have continuous electrical signals, but digital signals contain non-continuous electrical signals.
Analog Signal: It is a continuous signal in which a time-varying quantity represents another time-based variable. This type of signal works with physical values ​​and natural phenomena such as earthquakes, frequency, volcano, wind speed, weight, lighting, etc.
Digital Signal: It is a signal used to represent data as a series of discrete values ​​at any time, and it can only take one of a fixed number of values, where this type of signal represents a real number within a fixed range of values.

There is an example for each type.
